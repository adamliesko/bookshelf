# Crafting Rails Applications: Expert Practices for Everyday Rails Development

### @patrikbona

**TL;DR This book is for advanced Rails developers who wants to know how Rails
magic works and/or write their own Rails plugins.**

This book is for advanced Rails developers. Not for intermediates and definetely
not for beginners. But if you want to understand Rails more deeply than you
should read it.

Jose Valim is Rails core team member and also very good author. I like the style
in which is this book written.

Jose explains different Rails subsystems like Models, Controllers, Generators,
...  just before you need to know how they works so you can write some plugin
which utilizes or extend given subsystem.

And what I really liked is that everything is tested. So you will learn not just
how to write Rails plugins but also how to test them.

Personally I am not sure if I will use something from this book in near future
but I would like to keep it as a great Rails reference.
