**TL;DR A deep dive into geospatial PostgreSQL.**

This book is a great book for anyone looking into working with geospatial data. Plus, if you like PostgreSQL and relational databases as much as I do, prepare to be amazed by usage of PostgreSQL's most advanced features in some real world examples. This book has them all: window functions, recursive queries, triggers, expression indexes and more. 

Having never worked with serious geospatial data except som basic lat-long modelling, this is was a very refreshing read and you will find everything you need here for a quick start into the wonderful world of maps, vectors, topologies. I especially liked that authors give you overview of the "full stack" with recommendations. You will find listings of possible tools you can use, with the pros/cons listed. This literally saved me hours if I had to find, install and try out them all.
