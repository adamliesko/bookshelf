**TL;DR Current trends and insights in Big Data and its tools from O’Reilly.**

Big Data Now is a collection of essays concerning usage and scalability of applications using Big Data. Therefore, it’s rather a collection of personal experiences of experts working with Big Data than definitive guide to what Big Data is - or isn’t. The essays summarize current trends in Big Data, tools for processing Big Data and the application of Big Data for solving various problems from traffic jams to effectiveness of health care.

First essay by Edd Dumbill explains what Big Data is and how companies like Google, Facebook or Walmart use data collected from their customers to improve their services. Moreover, because of the spread of various cloud providers and opensource software, the utilization of Big Data is feasible even for small startups or individuals pursuing data mining. Edd continues with presenting opensource tools for processing Big Data like Hadoop, Hive, Mahout and others. For example, Facebook friends recommendation is cooked by Hadoop where the computation happen and the results are cached in MySQL database. Edd’s essay provides a detailed insight into current usage of Big Data and its tools that most of the companies like Facebook or Cloudera use for processing their data.

*Mining the Astronomical Literature by Alasdair Allan* concerns collecting the research papers for more than last hundred years. They used number of data mining algorithms to extract interesting data about number of authors during years, trending topics in astronomy over the years and clustering papers by common research area, authors or references. Another interesting visualization was frequency of core topics in astronomy over the years - e.g. comparison of dark matter and dark energy references.

*Solving the Wanamaker Problem for Health Care by Tim O’Reilly, Julie Steele, Mike Loukides and Colin Hill* is last essay and, for me, the most interesting one. Authors discussed how Big Data can affect effectiveness of health care and improve diagnosis based on data mining. Authors addressed the key problem of data in health care - decentralization. A lot of medical records are still not digitally available due to historical reason and they format differs from record to record. Besides, many companies focused on health care like *23andMe* or *PatientsLikeMe* have a portion of medical data about their customers and partial solution for the problem of medical records lies in merging those data to provide more detailed view of patient profile. The benefits of mining Big Data in health care is predicting the effectiveness of medication for a patient based on the statistics of other patients response to the same medication. Authors also discussed other difficulties for utilization of Big Data in health care, mainly addressing concerns of pharmaceutical companies, but that’s enough spoilers for now…

To sum up, Big Data Now is a good reference for current trends in Big Data and its tools. It provides insight from people experienced in mining Big Data and their essays issue interesting examples of Big Data usage in academic and successful commercial project as well. It’s definitely worth reading for every data scientist or enthusiast.
