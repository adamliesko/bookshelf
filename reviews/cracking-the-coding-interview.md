**TL;DR A great read for developers who want to get back to their school times and brush up their skills in Data structures and algorithms before upcoming interview.**

*Cracking the coding interview* is a 170 pages (not counting solutions to the questions) long book, that tries to prepare job candidates for their interviews. It covers wide range of topics, of which some (the more advanced) are really lacking. Book is split into three main sections, which are written with the interview process in mind.

**1. Interview process**

These are the chapters which can improve whole interview process and help you to score the job. From the common mistakes, dress-code, dealing with people from management or CV advice to the quality and testing of the code, approach to algorithmic questions and finally  ending with offer, negotiation..  all is pretty well covered. This section is written in a more of a abstract or human point of view. Included is a chapter of Behind the scenes - interview process in the larges tech companies (Apple, Google, Facebook.)
I would have to say that I haven't found anything that would make me go 'wow', that you can't find on the internet, but the all of the information is neatly structured and really compact.

**2. Interview questions**

 The format of these chapters is following: First there is some theoretical knowledge about the topic and tips. Then, there are few selected problems with their solutions written in Java. At last there is a list of few (10+) programming questions about the topic.

Here you can find low level basics about Data structures and algorithms. Unfortunately parts like scalability, databases, threads and lock are really poorly written.

**2. Solutions to programming question**

 Java solutions (sometimes multiple) to the previously listed programming questions. Beside the code snippets with explanation  there is usually some background talk about the problem, possible optimisations and graphical illustrations. Solutions in multiple languages (also Ruby) can be found in the authors Github [repo](https://github.com/gaylemcd/ctci).

**Summary:** To sum up, I think this book is worth reading even when you are not actively looking for a job. Although lot of the sections are really basic, you get to read something of which you might not be doing on daily basis because of the popularity of high level languages (e.g. implementing merge sort, string manipulation, bitwise operations, tree traversal) that can come up useful later one day. This book can be read in one evening without going through the code questions and solutions.
