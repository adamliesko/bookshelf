**TL;DR I would recommend this book to a beginner in this field, as the book is concise, explains the basics of the R language very well and covers briefly many topics, in which the reader can follow up alone if he's interested and already has gotten overview of this language and its capabilities - by reading this book one can achieve this goal definitely. I give this book 3 stars out of 5.**

Before reading this book, I completed Computing for Data Analysis and Statistics One courses on coursera, where all the exercises were coded in R. 

The book consists of two parts. In the **first** part the author introduces **basic concepts of R** (data structures, scopes, working with strings and dates, loading 3rd party packages etc.)  to his readers, where in the **second** one the whole **data analysis workflow** (getting and cleaning of data - xml/html/csv/unstructured - you name it, visualisation and modeling, coding your own packages, testing) is presented.

Almost **every paragraph** which introduces new knowledge to the reader is followed by a **snippet of code** with its precise output. At the end of each chapter, there are 5 **quiz questions** and 3 **exercises**. Examples of code are helpful, accurate and follow each other appropriately, but sometimes the output is **too long** and one has to go back a few pages to find a variable which is reffered to in an example, but defined in the previous one. Sometimes output of two examples differs only in one line, merging of those code snippets (and their output) could speed up reading without confusing the user. The problem of spending **too many pages where** it is **not** necessarily **needed** is for me the main flaw of this book. Chapters which cover stuff very similar to other programming languages (Flow Control and Loops) could be shorter, pinpointing mainly R's specifics. Others like Advanced Looping could get more love with the form of either code snippets & their output or by breaking the rule of 5 exercises.

Other example to spare some place is definitely in the Exploring and **Visualizing part**. The author himself states that learning all three R's plotting systems is **overkill**, because ggplot2 is the most modern one and knowing to work with it is sufficient. In spite of this, this chapter contains examples using all three plotting systems. On the other hand, **no examples** with **either statistics or machine learning** packages are given. At least, the author recommends some sources where these topics are covered. 

To sum up, I would **recommend** this book **to** a **beginner in this field**, as the book is **concise**, explains the **basics** of the R language **very well** and covers briefly many topics, in which the reader can follow up alone if he's interested and already has gotten overview of this language and its capabilities - by reading this book one can achieve this goal definitely. I give this book **3 stars out of 5**.
