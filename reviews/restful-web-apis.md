I was a bit confused from this book. The first half of it is definitely useful for anyone who
has no previous experience with HTTP (apart from using it unconsciously) and APIs. And even if you do 
have some experience with HTTP and you APIs, you will probably benefit from the book - there is a strong chance that
you will learn something new that you were not aware before - maybe you ignored existence of HTTP OPTIONS request or
did not know about JSON-LD profile... The first half of a book is packed with useful information presented 
in a clear way and logical order.

What I did not like that much was the second part of the book, which is mostly a zoo. Literally. A zoo of standards
and formats. Although interesting, it is not very useful in a way it is presented. There are so many of them coming
in quickly one after another, this one inspired by that one and expanding another one...that you will soon get a little 
bit lost. At least I did. Authors made a perfect job by providing quick reference to many useful information such as 
HTTP status codes in appendices. I wonder why they did not move the zoo part into an appendix. Some sort of a 
clearer overview of possibilities, limitations, advantages etc would suit the main matter much better.

Having said that, I nevertheless consider the book as very useful to anyone, who 
is interested in Web development. It presents nice ideas of self-contained and discoverable 
APIs and generic clients which are not bound to a specific implementation of a certain service. 
I wonder whether it will really become a wide-spread practice one day - despite of techniques and standards
described in the book, I still see the semantic gap as an unresolved issue.
