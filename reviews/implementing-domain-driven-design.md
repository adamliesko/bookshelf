**TL;DR Not worth your time. Avoid.**

Having read the original Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans, I clearly had great expectations for this one. Acording to reviews on Amazon, a great book with more to-the-code approach. This however did not met any of my expectations. A slug to read, trivial concepts explained in great lengths and to be honest, nothing really new. The chapter on bounded contexts was possibly the only thing that gave me something. I would not recommend this to anyone since I had hard time reading it to the end.
