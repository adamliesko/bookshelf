**TL;DR Several case studies for different data analysis tasks implemented using Spark. Applications of Read-Evaluate-Print Loop interface in the distributed environment. Great introductory tutorials with practical advices and references for further reading.**

The book demonstrates the application of Spark in many data analysis domains. It emphasizes the utility of application of the same code in the exploratory analysis of the data at scale and application of acquired knowledge and created models in production. One of the most important Spark features presented in the book is the availability of REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) environment known from other languages, such as R or Python, popular in data science community. Spark however allows one to use this environment for interactive analysis not only on a single machine, but it allows transparently distribute the workload to the whole cluster.

The application of Spark is demonstrated on multiple attractive topics and applications of data analysis and machine learning such as music recommendation using collaborative filtering, network traffic anomaly detection using data clustering or estimating investment risk using Monte Carlo simulation. These case studies provide simple tutorials for implementation of different data analysis tasks in Spark but at the same time provide basic theoretical and practical introduction to the method itself. Every case study focuses on the processed dataset at hand, but references to related materials and next steps are provided for further study.
