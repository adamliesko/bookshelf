**TL;DR Great overview of Ruby on Rails testing ecosystem, not so great if you actually want to learn testing.**

Rails 4 Test Prescriptions is a well written book about the current state of Ruby/Rails testing. If you are new to Rails/Ruby testing world, this book is invaluable. You will find everything you need to test you code from every angle. Testing models, controllers, helpers, views, frameworks... it's all there. However if you are looking for a great intro into TDD/BDD I would recommend you look up classics by Kent Beck: Test Driven Development by Example or if you want to get more advanced grab a copy of Growing Object Oriented Software Guided by Tests by Nat Pryce and Steve Freeman. These are Java books, but game-changing reads.
